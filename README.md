# Binary Snake


### Inital setup to play game localy

Clone
```
```
To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```

### Inspiration
  Inspired to create educational game, both of us, Kerry and Jenny have a passion towards education. It's based on the original snake but with some twists.
  Changes:
  * You can no longer hit yourself and die
  * Instead of just having one food source, you're given the option of two, one containing a one and the other a zero.
  * Goal is to get the number (given in decimal) and convert it to binary by eating the correct bits.
